### Current stable version: 2.0.0

**cucumber** is a complete moderation plugin for PocketMine-MP which features ban/mute management and logging of various significant events.

If you are upgrading from **v1.6.2**, just update the cucumber `.phar`. Do not delete configuration files, they will automatically be updated and save your settings :-)

### Punishment Management
cucumber enables banning of players and IPs, muting and warning.

It also includes IP bans pertaining to the player's IP. The player's first join and last join dates are also displayed                                                       |

#### Duration
In a duration argument:
* `y`: year
* `M`: month
* `w`: week
* `d`: day
* `h`: hour
* `m`: minute

For instance, `1y3M` means one year and three months (this is the same as `15M`). `1w2d12h` means one week, two days, and twelve hours (this is the same as `9d12h`).

For an infinite duration (a punishment that never expires), you can enter one of the following: `inf`, `infinite`, `perm`, `permanent`, `-1`.

### Logging
cucumber logs various events¹ to a path specified in `config.yml`. Several loggers (including custom ones) can also be defined in `config.yml`. (By default, a `BaseLogger` exists that logs everything to `log_out.txt`.) Messages are written to the file every 10 seconds asynchronously.

¹ cucumber logs the following: join, join attempt (if a player attempts to join while banned), quit, chat, chat attempt (if a player attempts to chat while muted), command

### Miscellaneous
cucumber also has miscellaneous moderation commands that are not related to punishment management.

|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/rawtell`  | Send a raw message to a player                          | `/rawtell <player> <message> [-nomessage\|-nom] [-popup\|-p] [-title\|-t]` | `-nomessage` does not send a chat message<br>`-popup` sends a popup<br>`-title`sends a title                    |
| `/log`      | Log a message                                           | `/log <message> [-severity\|-s <severity>]`                                | `-severity` specifies the severity at which to log the message. See below for more informaiton about severities |
| `/alert`    | Broadcast a message to the server                       | `/alert <message> [-nomessage\|-nom] [-popup\|-p] [-title\|-t]`            | `-nomessage` does not send a chat message<br>`-popup` sends a popup<br>`-title` sends a title                   |
| `/ip`       | Get a player's IP and their alt accounts                | `/ip <player>`                                                             | This shows every account that has the same IP as the player                                                     |
| `/vanish`   | Vanish from other players' sight                        | `/vanish`                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |

#### Severity
In a severity tag:
* `log`: Normal, ordinary events
* `notice`: Normal but interesting events
* `important`: Significant events
* `alert`: Exceptional events that likely require monitoring

If a message is logged at the `important` severity, for instance, loggers that listen to higher severities (ex. `alert`) will not pick it up. This is useful if you want to have an `alert` logger that sends you a Discord notification, for example.
